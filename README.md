# hw5-workday-scheduler

In this Workday Scheduler I've utilized the Moment.js library to work with date and time.

The goal of this program is to create a daily event planner that allows you to store information in a schedule and gets recalled from local storage. 

This program has CSS and Javascript (jQuery) code that allows us to change colors to add visibility and help differentiate past blocks, current blocks, and future blocks.

Thanks!
